Nos.\\r\\n372 of 1943 and 634 of 1944 which were appeals from the orders of the Subordinate Judge of Ellore in E.A. No. 440 of 1937 and C.M.P. No. 152 of 1943 in O.S. No. 87 of 1923.\\r\\nP. Somasundaram (V. V. Choudhry, with him) for the appellant.\\r\\nV. Rangachari (K. Mangachari, with him) for the respond ents. 1950.\\r\\nOctober 17.\\r\\nThe Court delivered judgment as follows.\\r\\nFAZL ALI J.\\r\\nThese appeals arise out of an execution proceeding, and the main point to be decided in them is what is the effect of certain provisions of the Madras Agricul turists \\' Relief Act (Madras Act IV of 1938, which will hereinafter be referred to as \"the Madras Act\"), on the rights of the parties.\\r\\nHow this point arises will be clear from a brief statement of the facts of the case.\\r\\nIt appears that in 1908, one Veeresalingam, the husband of the first respondent, borrowed a sum of Rs. 9,000 from one Sitharamayya, and executed a mortgage bond in his fa vour.\\r\\nSubsequently a suit was 808 instituted by the mortgagee to enforce the mortgage and a final decree in that suit was passed on the 19th August, 1926.\\r\\nThereafter, on the 28th October, 1931,the decree holder applied for the execution of the decree by the sale of the mortgaged property.\\r\\nIn 193a, the decree holder transferred the decree to one Sobhanadri, after whose death his son, the appellant before us, was brought on the record as his legal representative in the execution proceedings.\\r\\nSeveral years before the assignment of the decree, Veeresa lingam, the defendant, had died and his widow, the first respondent.\\r\\nwas therefore brought on the record as his legal representative.\\r\\nOn the 6th July, 1935, two items of proper ty were sold in execution of the decree and purchased by the decree holder, these being : (1) a village called Tedlam in in West Godavari District; and (2) 4 acres and 64 cents of land in Madepalli village.\\r\\nThe first property was sold for Rs. 21,000 and the second for \\' Rs. 1,025.\\r\\nAs, however, the amount due under the decree was only about Rs. 17,860 and odd, the sale of the second property was subsequently set aside and the decree holder deposited into Court the excess amount of about Rs. 3,000 and odd after setting off the decretal amount against the price of the first item of property.\\r\\nOn the 5th August, 1935, the first respondent filed an application under Order XXI, rule 90, and section 47 of the Code of Civil Procedure, to set aside the sale held in July, 1935, alleging certain irregularities in the conduct of the sale.\\r\\nThat application was after several years heard by the Subordinate Judge of Ellore, who by his order dated the 6th March, 1943, dismissed it and directed the sale of the first property to be confirmed and full satisfaction of the decree to be entered.\\r\\nAfter about 12 days, i.e., on the 18th March, 1943, the first respondent and the second respondent, who had been adopted by the former on the 12th March, 1936, under the will of her hus band and was subsequently brought on record, filed an appli cation under section 19 of the Madras Act praying for cer tain reliefs under that Act.\\r\\nThis application \\' was dismissed on the 22nd March, 1943.\\r\\nSubsequently, two appeals were filed on behalf 809 of the respondents (who will hereinafter be sometimes re ferred to as judgment debtors), one against the order refus ing to set aside the sale under Order XXI, rule 90 of the Civil Procedure Code, and the other against the order dis missing the application under the Madras Act.\\r\\nThese appeals were heard together by two learned Judges of the Madras High Court and they took the view that the judgment debtors \\' application under the Madras Act was maintainable notwith standing the fact that the sale had been confirmed and full satisfaction of the decree recorded, and remitted the case to the trial Court for a finding on the following questions, namely (1) whether the applicants were agriculturists; and (2) if so, what would be the result of applying the provisions of Madras Act IV of 1938 to the decretal debt against them ? So far as regards the judgment debtors \\' appeal against the order dismissing their application under Order XXI, rule 90, the Learned Judges were inclined to agree with the trial Court that the sale should stand but declined to pass final orders in the appeal on the ground that \"it would seriously prejudice the judgment debtors in the connected application for relief under section 19 of the Madras Act IV of 1938.\\r\\n\" The Subordinate Judge answered the questions referred to him by the High Court on remand as follows : (1) The judgment debtors were not agriculturists and were not therefore entitled to the benefits of the Madras Act;and (2) If they were agriculturists, they were not liable to pay anything under the decree, as, in view of the provisions of the Act, the debt stood discharged on the date of sale.\\r\\nWhen however the matter came up before the learned Judges of the High Court, they reversed the first finding of the trial Court and held that the judgmentdebtors were agriculturists within the meaning of the 810 Act, and that the debt stood discharged in view of section 8 (2) of the Act.\\r\\nAt the same time, they held that the sale was not liable to be set aside, and in this view dismissed one of the appeals and allowed the other.\\r\\nThen followed certain proceedings to which it would have been unnecessary to refer but for the fact that the judgment debtors have attempted to rely on \"them in support of one of their preliminary objections to the maintainability of these appeals.\\r\\nIt appears that on the next day after the judgment of the High Court was delivered in the two appeals, counsel for the respondents wrote a letter to the Registrar of the High Court to direct the posting of the two cases \\'for being mentioned \\' before the Court in order to obtain necessary directions consequent on the orders passed by it in the appeals.\\r\\nThis letter was not placed before the learned Judges until the judgment had been signed by them and ac cordingly the judgment debtors filed two petitions, one being a review petition to the High Court and the other being a petition to the trial Court praying \"that the de creeholder may be ordered to pay to the petitioners the purchase money of Rs. 21,000 with interest thereon at 6 per cent.\\r\\nper annum from the date of sale till the date of payment.\\r\\n\" The trial Court dismissed the latter petition on the ground that it was not maintainable, and the judgment debtors filed an appeal against the order.\\r\\nThe appeal as well as the review petition of the judgment debtors were heard together by the learned Judges who directed the decree holder \\'s counsel to elect whether his client would deposit the purchase money into Court or have the sale set aside.\\r\\nThe decree holder applied for a short adjournment and ultimately on the 15th November, 1946, his counsel stated that his client wished to retain the property which he had purchased and to pay the purchase money into Court.\\r\\nThereupon, he was directed to pay the sum of Rs. 21,000 together with interest within a months from that date.\\r\\nSubsequently, the appellant (decree holder) having obtained leave to appeal from the High Court preferred 811 these appeals before us.\\r\\nIt may be stated here that along with the application for leave to appeal, the appellant had filed an application for excusing the delay in filing the former application which he accounted for mainly by refer ring to the proceedings for the review of the judgments in the previous appeals to the High Court.\\r\\nThis application was granted and the delay was condoned.\\r\\nAs has been already stated, the main point arising in these appeals relates to the effect of the Madras Act upon this litigation.\\r\\nThat Act was passed and came into effect in 1938, while the execution proceedings were still continu ing.\\r\\nIt will be recalled that the sale took place on the 6th July, 1935; and the application for setting it aside was not disposed of until the 6th March, 1943.\\r\\nBut, strangely enough, the judgmentdebtors did not apply for any relief under the Madras Act during this period, and they made their application only after the sale had been confirmed and satisfaction of the decree had been entered.\\r\\nHow far this belated application affects the right claimed by the judg ment debtors under the Act is one of the questions raised in these appeals, and I shall deal with it after referring to the material provisions of the Act and the findings of the High Court which have given rise to several debatable points.\\r\\nThe sections of the Act which are material for the purpose of these appeals are sections 3, 8 and 19.\\r\\nSection 3 defines an agriculturist and has a proviso stating that in certain cases a person shall not be deemed to be an agricul turist.\\r\\nThe relevant clause of this proviso, to which I shall also have to advert later, is clause (D) which runs thus : \"Provided that a person shall not be deemed to be an \\'agriculturist \\' if he (D) is a landholder of an estate under the Madras Es tates Land Act, 1908, or of a share or portion thereof in respect of which estate, share or portion any sum exceeding Rs. 500 is paid as peshkash or any sum exceeding Rs. 100 is paid as quit rent, jodi, kattubadi, 812 poruppu or the like or is a janmi under the Malabar Tenancy Act, 1929, who pays any sum exceeding Rs. 500 as land reve nue to the Provincial Government. \\' \\' The precise question which is said to arise with refer ence to this provision is whether by reason of being the owners of village Tedlam, the judgment debtors should be held to be not entitled to relief under the Act.\\r\\nThe other material sections 8 and 19 run as follows : \"8.\\r\\nDebts incurred before the 1st October, 1932, shall be scaled down in the manner mentioned hereunder, namely: (1) All interest outstanding on the 1st October, 1937, in favour of any creditor of an agriculturist whether the same be payable under law, custom or contract or under a decree of Court and whether the debt or other obligation has ripened into a decree or not, shall be deemed to be dis charged, and only the principal or such portion thereof as may be outstanding shall be deemed to be the amount repay able by the agriculturist on that date.\\r\\n(2) Where an agriculturist has paid to any creditor twice the amount of the principal whether by way of princi pal or interest or both, such debt including the principal, shall be deemed to be wholly discharged.\\r\\n(3) Where the sums repaid by way of principal or inter est or both fall short of twice the amount of the principal, such amount only as would make up this shortage, or the principal amount or such portion of the principal amount as is outstanding, whichever is smaller, shall be repayable.\\r\\n(4) Subject to the provisions of sections 22 to 25, nothing contained in sub sections (1), (2) and (8) shall be deemed to require the creditor to refund any sum which has been paid to him, or to increase the liability of a debtor to pay any sum in excess of the amount which would have been payable by him if this Act had not been passed.\\r\\n813 Explanation.\\r\\nWhere a debt has been renewed or included in a fresh document in favour of the same creditor, the principal originally advanced by the creditor together with such sums, if any, as have been subsequently advanced as principal shall alone be treated as the principal sum repay able by the agriculturist under this section.\\r\\nWhere \\' before the commencement of this Act, a Court has passed a decree for the repayment of a debt, it shall, on the application of any judgmentdebtor who is an agricul turist or in respect of a Hindu joint family debt, on the application of any member of the family whether or not he is the judgment debtor or on the application of the decree holder, apply the provisions of this Act to such decree and shall, notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, amend the decree accordingly or enter satisfaction, as the case may be: Provided that all payments made or amounts recovered, whether before or after the commencement of this Act, in respect of any such decree shall first be applied in payment of all costs as originally decreed to the creditor.\\r\\n\" These sections are material, because in the present case the judgment debtors asked the decree to be amended under section 19 of the Act and they were held to be entitled to relief under section 8.\\r\\nHaving referred to the relevant provisions of the Act, it becomes necessary now to state the main findings of the High Court upon which the decision of this appeal will turn.\\r\\nThese findings are (1) that the sale of Tedlam village, which was held on the 6th July, 1935, and confirmed on the 6th March, 19 13, was a good sale; (2) that by this sale.\\r\\nthe title to the Tedlain village passed to the decree hoMer.\\r\\nand in hearing the appeal the High Court was justified in proceeding on the footing that the judgment debtors having ceased to be the owners of Tedlam village after its sale, were not 104 814 hit by clause (D) of the proviso to section a of the Act; and (3) that the decree had been satisfied at the date of the sale and the decree holder was liable to repay to the judg ment debtors the full price of the property which was sold.\\r\\nThe main contentions directed against the conclusions arrived at by the High Court are :firstly, that they are self contradictory, because if the sale was an effective sale on the date it was held or confirmed, the decree was also satisfied on that date and the judgmentdebtors were no longer entitled to invoke the provisions of the Madras Act; and secondly, that the view taken by the learned Judges of the High Court that notwithstanding the appeal against the order refusing to set aside the sale they could proceed on the footing that the judgment debtors had ceased to be the owners of Tedlarn village on the date of the sale was un sound in law.\\r\\nIt will first deal with the second point which appears to me to require serious consideration.\\r\\nThe High Court has in my opinion rightly proceeded on the footing that the ownership of Tedlam village would bring the judgment debtors within the mischief of clause (D) of the proviso to section 3 of the Act, and would disentitle them to any relief thereunder.\\r\\nThis view was contested before us on behalf of the judgment debtors on two grounds : (1) that the grant in favour of the ancestor of the judgment debtors did not comprise a whole inam village and what they owned was therefore not an estate under the Madras Estates Land Act (Madras Act I of 1908); (2) that on the date of the application, the judg ment debtxrs were not landholders of village Tedlam because the village was in the possession of a receiver since 1st February, 1937, and the latter was in law the landholder on the crucial date.\\r\\nNone of these contentions however appears to me to have any force.\\r\\nThe first contention was sought to be supported by Exhibit P 1 which is a register of inams and which shows that poramboke or waste lands to the extent of 596 acres had to be deducted from the area 815 of the inam.\\r\\nThe point however has been dealt with very fully and clearly by the learned Subordinate Judge, who has rightly pointed out that it has no force in view of the Madras Estates Land (Amendment) Act, 1945 [Madras Act No. II of 1945].\\r\\nThe second point is equally unsubstantial, be cause it is well settled that the owner of a property does not cease to be its owner merely because it is placed in the hands of a receiver.\\r\\nThe true position is that the receiver represents the real owner whoever he may be, and the true owner does not by the mere appointment of a receiver cease to be a landholder under the Madras Estates Land Act.\\r\\nI will now revert to the crucial question in the case, viz., whether the learned Judges of the High Court were justified in law in deciding the appeal on the footing that the judgment debtors had ceased to be the owners of Tedlain village and on that account they were not hit by clause (D).\\r\\nof the proviso to section 3 of the Madras Act.\\r\\nAt this stage, it will be useful to refer to certain provisions of the Civil Procedure Code which directly bear on the question as to when title to immovable property which is sold in execution of a decree is deemed to pass to the purchaser.\\r\\nOne of the provisions is Order XXI, rule 92, which provides that \"where no application is made under rule 89, rule 90 or rule 91, or where such application is made and disallowed, the Court shall make an order confirming the sale, and thereupon the sale shall become absolute.\\r\\n\" The second rele vant provision is section 65 which runs thus : \"Where immovable property is sold in execution of a decree and such sale has become absolute, the property shall be deemed to have vested in the purchaser from the time when the property is sold and not from the time when the sale becomes absolute.\\r\\n\" In Bhawani Kunwar vs Mathurn Prasad Singh(1) the ques tion as to when a mortgagee who has purchased certain vil lages in execution of the decree acquired title to the properties purchased by him directly arose for considera tion, and the Privy Council rightly pointed (1) T.L.R. 816 out that \"the sale in execution of the mortgage decree took effect from the actual date of the sale and not from its confirmation.\" In a simple case, the provisions cited above should settle the controversy, but, in the present case, the matter has been complicated on account of the appeal against the order refusing to set aside the sale under Order XXI, rule 90.\\r\\nIn such a case, generally speaking, the true position seems to be that there is no finality until the litigation is finally determined by the appellate Court.\\r\\nThis principle has been recognized in a number of cases, but it will be enough to cite Chandramani Shaha vs Anarjan Bibi(1).\\r\\nThe headnote of that case runs as follows : \"Where a Subordinate Judge has disallowed an applica tion under Order XXI, rule 90, to set aside a sale in execu tion, and has made an order under rule (1) confirming the sale, and an appeal from disallowance has been dismissed by the High Court, the three years \\' period provided by the Indian Limitation Act, 1908, Schedule I, article 180, for an application under Order XXI, rule 95.\\r\\nby the purchaser for delivery of possession runs from the date of the order on appeal; the High Court having under the Code of Civil Proce dure, 1908, the same powers as the Subordinate Judge, the \\'time when the sale becomes absolute \\', for the purpose of article 180 is when the High Court disposes of the appeal.\" Under article 180 of the Indian Limitation Act, the period of limitation runs \"from the date when the sale becomes absolute.\\r\\n\" If we give a narrow and literal meaning to these words, the period of limitation should be held to run from the date when the original Court of execution confirms the sale.\\r\\nBut, as was pointed out by the Privy Council, the High Court as an appellate Court had the same powers as the trial Court and it is only when the appeal was dismissed by the High Court that the order of the trial Court confirming the sale became absolute.\\r\\nTill the deci sion of the appellate Court, no finality was attached to the order confirming the sale.\\r\\n(1) I.L.R. 61 Cal.\\r\\ng45. 817 It is clear that in this case the same rule would apply to the order recording satisfaction of the decree and to the order confirming the sale.\\r\\nIf the order recording satisfac tion of the decree was not final and remained an inchoate order until the appeal was decided, the order confirming the sale would have the same inchoate character.\\r\\nThis position seems to have been fully conceded in the statement of their case filed on behalf of the respondents in this Court.\\r\\nIt is quite clear that in this case the learned Judges of the High Court have taken up an inconsistent position.\\r\\nAs I have already stated, they have held, for the purpose of allowing one of the appeals, that the judgment debtors were not hit by clause (D)of the proviso to section 3 of the Act because they ceased to be the owners of Tedlain village at the date of the sale in 1935.\\r\\nIf this conclusion is cor rect, it must follow as a matter of logic that the decree was completely satisfied on the date of the sale, because the sale fetched a larger amount than what was payable under the decree and the excess amount was deposited by the de cree holder in Court.\\r\\nThe sale and satisfaction must go together and if finality is to be attached to the sale it should have been held to attach also to the order recording satisfaction of the decree.\\r\\nIt seems clear to me that if the decree had ceased to exist, no relief could be claimed by the judgment debtors under the Madras Act.\\r\\nOn the other hand, if the appeal had to be decided on the footing that the order recording satisfaction of the decree was not final, the same approach should have been made in regard to the effect of the sale.\\r\\nIt is also clear that if the decree was satisfied on the date of sale by the application of the provisions of the Act, the sale could not stand, because how could the property be sold in execution of a decree which had been already satisfied.\\r\\nYet, notwithstanding the fact that nothing was due under the decree, the High Court has held that the sale was a good sale and was to stand.\\r\\nThe correct approach to the case would have been to assume for the purpose of the appeals that neither of the orders passed by the 818 Subordinate Judge was final.\\r\\nOn that view, the appeals to the High Court could not have been decided on the footing that the judgment debtors had ceased to be the owners of Tedlain property and were therefore not hit by clause (D) of the proviso to section 3 of the Madras Act.\\r\\nIn my opinion, the judgment of the High Court cannot be sustained, and the appeal s will have to be allowed.\\r\\nI will now deal very briefly with two preliminary objec tions raised on behalf of the respondents.\\r\\nThe first objec tion is that the application for leave to appeal to his Majesty in Council against the order of the High Court was barred by limitation, inasmuch as the reasons stated in the affidavit filed by the appellant in the High Court in sup port of his application for excusing delay do not consti tute sufficient reason within the meaning of section 5 of the Limitation Act.\\r\\nThe answer to this objection will be found in the facts which have been already narrated.\\r\\nThe delay was caused mainly by reason of the review of the order of the High Court and the High Court considered that there as sufficient reason for condoning the delay.\\r\\nThis Court cannot override the discretion exercised by the High Court and the matter cannot be reopened in these appeals.\\r\\nThe second objection is based on the fact that the decree holder was given a choice by the High Court to elect wheth er he would deposit the purchase money or have the sale set aside, and his counsel told the learned Judges on the 15th November, 1946 that his client wished to retain the property which he had purchased and pay the purchase money in cash.\\r\\nIt is contended that in view of this statement it was not open to the appellant to contend that he need not pay any amount to the judgment debtors.\\r\\nThis objection also is entirely devoid of any substance,because there is nothing on record to show that the appellant has consented to be bound by the order of the High Court and waived his right to appeal against it by reason of the election.\\r\\nThe learned counsel for the respondents also contended that the sale should have been set aside by the 819 High Court because the permission given to the decreeholder on the 16th February, 1934, to bid and set off the decretal amount against the purchase price was confined to an earlier sale and did not extend to the sate which took place on the 16th March, 1935, after the upset price which had been originally fixed was reduced.\\r\\nPersonally, I am inclined to hold that the permission covered the sale in question, but in any case it is difficult to hold on the facts stated that there was any such material irregularity as would vitiate the sale.\\r\\nThe precise argument which is put forward here was advanced in the Courts below but it did not find favour either with the Subordinate Judge or with the High Court.\\r\\nBesides, the respondents cannot raise the point in these appeals because they have filed no appeal against the order of the High Court upholding the sale.\\r\\nIn these circumstances, I would allow the appeals, set aside the orders of the High Court and restore the order of the learned Subordinate Judge.\\r\\nThere will however be no order as to costs in these appeals.\\r\\nMUKHERJEA J. I concur in the judgment just now deliv ered by ray learned brother, Fazl Ali J., and there is nothing further which I can usefully add.\\r\\nCHANDRASEKHARA AIYAR J.\\r\\nThe facts which have cha given rise to these appeals and the questions for decision have been stated in the judgment just now pronounced by my learned brother Fazl Ali J. I wish to add only a few words on the main contention advanced for the respondents by their learned Advocate, Mr. V. Rangachari.\\r\\nIf by reason of the confirmation of sale and satisfac tion of the decree having been entered up, the title to the village had passed indefeasibly to the decreeholder, there was no longer any decree or decree debt to be scaled down.\\r\\nIf, however, the title did not pass, because it was still open to the respondents to attack the Court sale under Order XXI, rule 90, they were landholders of the village and, as such, they would 820 come within the scope of proviso (D) to section 3 of the Madras Agriculturists \\' Relief Act, 1938, which enacts that a landholder who holds a village paying more than Rs. 100 as quit rent or jodi is not an agriculturist within the meaning of the Act.\\r\\nThe apparent inconsistency in the view taken by the High Court was recognised, if not conceded, by the learned coun sel.\\r\\nIn one view, there ,,as no longer any decree in respect of which the Agriculturists \\' Relief Act could operate; and in the other view, the respondents could not take advantage of the Act, as their ownership of the village precluded them.\\r\\nFaced with this dilemma, Mr. Rangachari urged a some what ingenious argument.\\r\\nHe contended that though the.\\r\\ntitle passed to the decree holder on the confirmation of sale and became vested in him from the date of the sale, the respo dents could still be regarded as having an interest in the village, as the sale was open or liable to challenge and the title \\'of the decree holder was inchoate or incomplete.\\r\\nThere is, however, really no support for this position.\\r\\nOn confir mation, the title of the decree holder became absolute or complete.\\r\\nIf the sale was set aside, the title would revest in the judgment debtor.\\r\\nThere is nothing like an equitable title in the decree holder which could be recognised for certain purposes and not recognised for others.\\r\\nUnder the Madras Act, \"agriculturist\" means \"a person who has a saleable interest in any agricultural or horticul tural land or one who holds interest in such land under a landholder as a tenant, ryot or undertenure holder.\" Section 10, sub clause (i) of the Act provides that the right conferred on an agriculturist to have a debt scaled down will not apply to any person who, though an \"agriculturist\" as defined in the Act, did not on 1 10 1937 hold an interest in or a lease or sub lease of any land.\\r\\nAfter the sale in 1935, the only interest which the judgment debtors had in the village was to have the sale set aside, under the rele vant provisions of the Civil Procedure Code.\\r\\nThis interest is not the interest contemplated by section 3, sub clause (ii) (a) & (b) of the Act which speaks of a 821 saleable interest or interest as a tenant, ryot or underten ure holder.\\r\\nI agree in the conclusion reached by my learned broth er.\\r\\nAppeals allowed.\\r\\n', {'entities': [(10, 27, 'CASE_NUMBER'), (61, 96, 'COURT'), (98, 106, 'JUDGE'), (111, 129, 'JUDGE'),

Dominion of Pakistan and that defendant No. 2 was a Revenue officer of that Province, the Court had no jurisdiction to hear the suit or make an order of injunction against the defendants.\\r\\nIt was stated that the Province of East Bengal appeared only to contest the jurisdiction of the Court.\\r\\nBy another written statement filed on the same day defendant No. 2 raised also other pleas in defence but his name was struck off the record at the plaintiff \\'s instance as not being a necessary party to the suit.\\r\\nOn the 10th December, 1947, the Province of East Bengal was substituted as the defendant in the place of the Province of Bengal which had ceased to exist, and the writ ten statement filed on behalf of the former was accepted.\\r\\nThereupon the Subordinate Judge framed a preliminary issue on the question of jurisdiction and, as stated al ready, found it for the plaintiff relying on section 9 of the Indian Independence Act and article 4 of the Indian Inde pendence (Legal Proceedings) Order, 1947.\\r\\nIt may be men tioned in passing that the assessment of the plaintiff was proceeded with by the Agricultural Income tax Officer, Comilla Range (East Bengal), who, by his order dated the 22nd December, 1947, imposed on the plaintiff a tax of Rs. 1,79,848 12 0 for 1944 45 and Rs. 1,34,326 7 0 for 1945 46, but the recovery of the amounts has been deferred under orders of the Court pending the decision on the preliminary issue.\\r\\nAs pointed out by the Federal Court in Midnapore 7 Zemindary Co. Ltd. vs The Province of Bengal and ,Others (1), the orders promulgated on the 14th August, 1947, by the Governor General of India before the partition in exercise of the powers conferred under section 9 of the Indian Independ ence Act, 1947, and containing provisions specially designed to remove the difficulties arising in connection with the transition to the new situation created by the partition are binding on both the Dominion of India and the Dominion of Pakistan.\\r\\nAmong such Orders those relevant to the present controversy are the Indian Independence (Legal Proceedings) Order, 1947, and the Indian Independence (Rights, Property and Liabilities)Order, 1947.\\r\\nBy article 4 of the former Order (1) All proceedings pending immediately before the appointed day in any of the special tribunals specified in col. 1 of the Schedule to this Order shall be continued in that tribunal as if the said Act had not been passed, and that tribunal shall continue to have for the purposes of the said proceedings all the jurisdiction and powers which it had immediately before the appointed day; * * * * (3) Effect shall be given within the territories of either of the two Dominions to any order or sentence of any such Special Tribunal as aforesaid and of any High Court in appeal or revision therefrom as if the order or sentence had been passed by a court of competent jurisdiction in that Dominion; * * * * and by article 12 (2) of the latter Order Where any Province from which property, rights or li abilities are transferred by this Order is, immediately before the transfer a party to legal proceedings with re spect to that property or those rights or liabilities the Province which succeeds to the property, rights or liabili ties in accordance with the provisions of this Order shall be deemed to be substituted for the other Province as a party to those proceedings and the proceedings may continue accordingly.\\r\\n(1) 8 On the effect of these provisions the learned Judges of the High Court observed: \"If this provision [i.e., article 12 (2)] applies to the present case, there can be no doubt that the Province of East Bengal was substituted in the suit for the Province of Bengal by operation of law, and by reason of the Legal Proceedings Order the suit shall continue in the Court of the Second Subordinate Judge, 24 Parganas, as a suit against the substituted defendant.\\r\\n\" With that statement of the position we entirely agree.\\r\\nThe learned Judges, however, proceeded to examine, laying stress on the words \"by this Order\" in article 12 (2), whether any property, rights or liabilities could be said to have been transferred by the Indian Independence (Rights, Property and Liabilities) Order, 1947, from the Province of Bengal to the Province of East Bengal, and they took the view that neither any property, nor rights, nor liabilities were so transferred under that Order and that, therefore, the con tinuation of the proceedings against the Province of East Bengal, which was now part of an Independent Sovereign State, was governed by the principles of international law and comity of nations, and that, according to those princi ples, East Bengal, being a Province of a sovereign state, could not be sued against its will in the municipal courts of India, with the result that the suit pending in the Court at Alipore must abate.\\r\\nThey also negatived a further con tention raised before them, apparently for the first time, to the effect that by reason of the petition filed on behalf of the Province of East Bengal for acceptance of its written statement condoning the delay involved and also by reason of sundry other proceedings for interim relief sought by the plaintiff which were actively resisted by the Province of East Bengal, that Province must be taken to have submitted to the jurisdiction of the Court.\\r\\nOn behalf of the appel lant, Mr. Sen Gupta challenged the correctness of the deci sion on both points.\\r\\nBefore dealing with these contentions, it will be con venient to dispose of two preliminary points raised by Mr. Faiyaz Ali, Advocate General of East Bengal.\\r\\n9 In the first place, he submitted that the State of Tripura having since been merged in the Dominion of India and a Chief Commissioner having been appointed to administer its territories, the appeal could no longer be prosecuted by the present Maharaja through his mother as his next friend.\\r\\nIt was, however, represented to us on his behalf that under the agreement of merger the Estate of Chakla Roshanabad was left to the Maharaja as his personal property and it no longer formed part of the territories of the Tripura State.\\r\\nThe Attorney General, appearing on behalf of the Dominion of India, the intervener, confirmed that position.\\r\\nThere is thus no substance in the objection as any formal defect in the proceeding could be set right by suitably amending the cause title.\\r\\nMr. Faiyaz Ali next drew our attention to the Pakistan (Indian Independence Legal Proceedings) Order, 1948, promul gated by the Governor General of Pakistan on 13th November, 1948, with retrospective effect from the 15th August, 1947, and pointed out that in view of its provisions any decree that might eventually be passed by the Court at Alipore would receive no effect in Pakistan and that, therefore, it was unnecessary for this Court to decide the question of the jurisdiction of the Alipore Court to proceed with the suit.\\r\\nWe are unable to take that view.\\r\\nThe effect of the Order referred to above on any decree that may eventually be passed in the pending suit may have to be taken note of by the Court trying that suit after hearing arguments on the validity of that Order which is challenged but we are at present concerned only with the question of the jurisdic tion of that Court to try the suit and we cannot at this stage refuse to give our ruling on that question merely because any decree that might be passed in favour of the plaintiff might prove ineffectual.\\r\\nTurning now to the main question, it is clear that article 12 (2) of the Rights, Property and Liabilities Order applies only to property rights or liabilities which were transferred by the Order from a Province which was a party to legal proceedings 2 10 \"with respect to\" that property or those rights or liabili ties.\\r\\nAs the suit in question cannot be said to have been instituted with respect to the property transferred, namely, Chakla Roshanabad, the appellant cannot rely upon the trans fer of that property from the Province of Bengal to the Province of East Bengal as part of the territories of Pakistan under the scheme of partition.\\r\\nNor was there any transfer of \"rights\"such as was contemplated under that article, for the only right with respect to which the Prov ince of Bengal could be said to have been a party to the pending proceeding on the facts of this case was the right to tax the agricultural income of the plaintiff under the provisions of the Bengal Agricultural Income tax Act, 1944, and that right was not derived by the Province of East Bengal by transfer under the Rights, Property and Liabili ties Order.\\r\\nAs rightly pointed out by the High Court, the right of taxation under the Bengal Act of 1944 passed to the Province of East Bengal as part of the Sovereign Dominion of Pakistan by virtue of the provisions of section 18(3) of the Indian Independence Act, 1947, which provided that \"the law of British India and of the several parts thereof immediate ly before the appointed day shall, so far as applicable and with the necessary adaptations, continue as the law of each of the new Dominions and the several parts thereof, until other provision is made by the laws of the legislature of the Dominion in question or by any other legislature or other authority having power in that behalf.\\r\\n\" The question next arises whether there was a transfer of any \"liability\" by the Order as contemplated in article 12(2).\\r\\nMr. Sen Gupta relied in this connection on article 10 (2) (a) which provides that \"where immediately before the appointed day the Province of Bengal is subject to any such liability (i.e., \"any liability in respect of an actionable wrong other than breach of contract\") referred to in sub section (1)that liability shall, where the cause of action arose wholly within the territories which, as from that day, are the territories of the Province of East Bengal, be a liability of that Province.\\r\\n\" It was contended that the Province 11 of Bengal was, according to the plaintiff \\'s case, liable to be restrained from proceeding with the illegal and unautho rised assessment on the basis of the notice issued under the Bengal Act of 1944, and that liability, in respect of which the cause of action arose wholly in Dacca (where the as sessment proceeding had been initiated) within the territo ries of the Province of East Bengal, became a liability of that Province.\\r\\nThe High Court rejected this contention on the ground \"that article 10(2) is concerned with the liabil ity for an actionable wrong other than breach of contract and it is impossible to say that by serving a notice on the plaintiff under the Bengal Agricultural Income tax Act through one of its officers the Province of Bengal had committed an actionable wrong \\'.\\r\\nAssuming that it exceeded its power or acted under an invalid provision of law, the plaintiff may have a declaration to that effect but the Act complained of cannot be said to have been a tortious act.\\r\\nBut even assuming that it was, it is to be remembered that the issue of the notice was an exercise of powers conferred by the Act in relation to the sovereign rights of the Crown and it is elementary that the Crown or the State is not answerable for even negligent or tortious acts of its offi cers done in the course of their official duties imposed by a statute, except where the particular act was specifically directed and the Crown profited by performance . .\\r\\nNo liability for an actionable wrong is thus involved in the suit and Dr. Sen Gupta cannot establish a right to proceed against the Province of East Bengal on the basis that the liability was transferred to that Province under article 10(2) of the Order.\\r\\n\" We are unable to share \\'this view.\\r\\nThe learned Judges have placed much too narrow a construction on the phrase \"liability in respect of an actionable wrong\".\\r\\nThey have assumed that the phrase connotes only a liability for dam ages for a completed, tortious act and that the initiation of what according to the plaintiff was an unauthorised and illegal assessment proceeding by purporting to serve a notice requiring the plaintiff to submit a return of his total agricultural income under section 24 (2) of the Bengal Agricultural 12 Income tax Act, 1944, through an appropriate officer func tioning under that Act, the Province of Bengal had not committed an \"actionable wrong\".\\r\\nThis, in our opinion, is not a correct view of the matter.\\r\\nUnder section 9(1) (b) of the Indian Independence Act, 1947, the Governor General of British India was directed to make provision by order \"for dividing between the new Dominions and between the new Provinces to be constituted under this Act, the powers, rights, property, duties and liabilities of the Governor General in Council or as the case may be of the relevant Provinces which under this Act are to cease to exist\", and the Indian Independence (Rights, Property and Liabilities) Order is the only Order by which such provision was made.\\r\\nThe intention being thus to provide for the initial distri bution of rights, property and liabilities as between the two Dominions and their Provinces, a wide and liberal con struction, as far as the language used would admit, should be placed upon the terms of the Order, so as to leave no gap or lacuna in relation to the matters sought to be provided for.\\r\\nThere is no reason, accordingly, why the words \"li ability in respect of an actionable wrong\" should be under stood in the restricted sense of liability for damages for completed tortious acts.\\r\\nWe consider that the words are apt to cover the liability to be restrained by injunction from completing what on the plaintiff \\'s case was an illegal or unauthorised act already commenced.\\r\\nThe service of the notice on the plaintiff under section 24(2) of the Bengal Act amounts to much more than a mere threat in the abstract to impose an illegal levy.\\r\\nIt is the actual initiation of an illegal assessment proceeding which, in the normal course, will \\'in all probability culminate in an illegal levy of tax.\\r\\nThe failure to make a return as required by the notice would result under section 25(5) of the Act in the Income tax Officer making an ex parte assessment to the best of his judgment and determining the sum payable by the assessee on the basis of such assessment.\\r\\nSuch failure would also expose the plaintiff under section 32(1) of the Act to the impo sition of a penalty which may equal the amount of the tax assessed on him or to a prosecution as for an offence 13 before a Magistrate under section 53 (1), at the option of the Income tax authority.\\r\\nIt is thus plain that the service of a notice requiring a return of income to be furnished for assessment under the Act is a step fraught with serious consequences to the assessee, and if the assessment proposed was illegal and unauthorised by reason of the Act itself being ultra vires in so far as it purported to make the Rulers of Indian States liable to taxation thereunder as contended for by the plaintiff, the service of such notice marked the commencement of a wrongful act against the plain tiff by the Bengal Government under colour of the Act and there can be no doubt that such a wrongful act is actionable in the sense that an action would lie in a civil court for an injunction restraining its completion.\\r\\nThat was the liability to which the Province of Bengal was subject ac cording to the plaintiff \\'s case at the time when he insti tuted the suit, and that liability, in our opinion, passed to the Province of East Bengal by virtue of article 10 (9.) (a) of the Indian Independence (Rights, Property and Liabil ities) Order, 1947.\\r\\nThere is no question here of the li ability of the Crown for damages for the negligent or tor tious act of its officers.\\r\\nOn the allegations in the plaint, which must, for the purpose of deciding the question of jurisdiction as a preliminary issue, be assumed to be well founded, the Province of Bengal was undoubtedly liable to be sued for an injunction restraining it from proceeding with the assessment and none the less so because the notice was served in purported exercise of powers conferred by the Bengal Act.\\r\\nThe name of the Income tax Officer originally impleaded as the second defendant having been struck off the record, no question in regard to his liability arises.\\r\\nReference was made to certain text books where a \"tort\" is spoken of as an \"actionable wrong\" and it was suggested that the two expressions are synonymous.\\r\\nEvery tort is undoubtedly an actionable wrong but the converse does not necessarily follow.\\r\\nIndeed, the words \"other than breach of contract\" used in article 10 (1) make it plain that the expression \"actionable wrong\" is used in a wider sense 14 which would have included breach of contract but for those limiting words.\\r\\nIt was said that even assuming that the service of the notice calling for a return of income was a wrongful act, it was not \"actionable\", as section 65 of the Bengal Act barred suits in civil courts \"to set aside or modify any assessment made under this Act\".\\r\\nThe short answer to this contention is that the suit in question is not a suit \"to set aside or modify an assessment\" made under the Act, as no assessment had yet been made when it was instituted, and the subsequent completion of the assessment was made by the Pakistan In come tax authorities on terms agreed to between the parties and sanctioned by the Court.\\r\\nThe decision of the Privy Council in Raleigh Investment Co. Ltd. vs Governor General in Council (1) relied on in support of the contention is distinguishable, as the main relief claimed there was repay ment of the tax alleged to have been wrongfully levied under colour of an ultra vires provision in the Indian Income tax Act.\\r\\nTheir Lordships observed: \"In form the relief claimed does not profess to modify or set aside the assessment.\\r\\nIn substance it does, for repayment of part of the sum due by virtue of the notice of demand could not be ordered so long as the assessment stood.\\r\\nFurther, the claim for the declaration cannot be rationally regarded as having any relevance except as leading up to the claim for repayment, and the claim for an injunction is merely verbiage.\\r\\nThe cloud of words fails to obscure the point of the suit.\\r\\n\" The position here is entirely different.\\r\\nThe gist of the wrongful act complained of in the present case is sub jecting the plaintiff to the harassment and trouble by commencing against him an illegal and unauthorised assess ment proceeding which may eventually result in an unlawful imposition and levy of tax.\\r\\nIt was suggested, somewhat faintly, that the cause of action for the suit, though stated in the plaint to have arisen in Dacca, now in the Province of East (1) 15 Bengal, did not arise wholly within the territories of the Province of East Bengal within the meaning of Article 10 (2) (a) inasmuch as the notice calling for a return, though issued from Dacca, was received by the Manager of the Estate at Agartalla in Tripura State.\\r\\nAssuming that the contention has any substance it is of no assistance to the respondent, for article 10 (2) (c) would then be applicable to the case and the Province of East Bengal would still be liable, though jointly with the Province of West Bengal.\\r\\nWe are therefore of opinion that the Province of East Bengal having succeeded to the liability to which the Province of Bengal was subject immediately before the ap pointed day, the former Province is to be deemed to be substituted for the other Province as a party to the suit and the suit must accordingly continue in the Court of the Subordinate Judge at Alipore, which has jurisdiction to proceed with it under article 4 of the Indian Independence (Legal Proceedings) Order, 1947.\\r\\nIn this view it is unnecessary to consider the question of submission to jurisdiction urged in the alternative by the appellant.\\r\\nIn the result the appeal is allowed, the order of the Court below is set aside and the suit now pending in the Court of the Subordinate Judge at Alipore will be heard and determined by it.\\r\\nThe respondent will pay the appellant \\'s costs throughout.\\r\\nFAZL ALI J.\\r\\nThe question to be decided in this appeal is whether the Subordinate Judge \\'s Court at Alipore in the State of West Bengal, has jurisdiction to try a suit in which the Province of East Bengal was impleaded as a defend ant, after the 15th August,1947 In what circumstances this question has arisen will appear from the facts of the case which may be briefly stated.\\r\\nIn 1944, the Bengal Legislature passed an Act called the Bengal Agricultural Income tax Act, 1944 (Bengal Act IV of 1944), which enabled it to impose a tax on the agricul tural income of various classes 16 of persons including \"every Ruler of an Indian State,\" holding lands within the territory of Bengal.\\r\\nThe appel lant, who is the Ruler of the State of Tripura, holds a zamindary called Chakla Roshanabad Estates, which was situ ated in the Province of Bengal and in the District of Sylhet formerly appertaining to the Province of Assam.\\r\\nOn the 28th February, 1945, the Agricultural Income tax Officer, Dacca Range, issued a notice under section 24 (2) of the Bengal Act to the Manager of the Chakla Roshanabad Estates calling upon him to furnish a return of the appellant \\'s total agri cultural income for the previous year, derived from lands situated within the Province of Bengal.\\r\\nOn the 12th June, 1945, the appellant instituted a suit in the Court of the Subordinate Judge at Dacca, against the Province of Bengal and the Agricultural Income tax Officer, Dacca Range, claim ing the following reliefs: (1) For a declaration that the Bengal Agricultural Income tax Act, 1944, so far as it imposes a liability to pay agricultural income tax on the plaintiff is ultra vires and void and that the plaintiff \\' is not bound by the same.\\r\\n(2) For a declaration that in any case the notice served by the Agricultural Income tax Officer, Dacca Range, above referred to, is void and of no effect and that no assessment can be made on the basis of that notice.\\r\\n(3) For a perpetual injunction to restrain the defend ants from taking any steps to assess the plaintiff to agricultural income tax.\\r\\nOn the 15th July, 1945, the suit was transferred to the Court of the Subordinate Judge at Alipore in the District of 24 Parganas, by an Order of the Calcutta High Court.\\r\\nWhile the suit was still pending, the new Province of East Bengal, which forms part of the territories of the Dominion of Pakistan, came into existence on the 15th August, 1947, as a result of the Indian Independence Act, 1947, and it appears that the whole of Chakla Roshanabad Estates falls within that Province.\\r\\nAfter the creation of the new Province, 17 a petition was filed on the 9th December, 1947, on behalf of the Province of East Bengal, drawing the attention of the Court at Alipore to the fact that the Province of West Bengal, which forms part of the territories of the Dominion of India, was taking no interest in the suit and asking the Court to accept a written statement which was also filed along with the petition, and in which the only plea taken was that the Alipore Court had no jurisdiction to hear the suit or make any order of injunction against the Province of East Bengal or defendant No. 2.\\r\\nThe last paragraph of the written statement was to the following effect: \"The Province of East Bengal appears only to contest the jurisdiction of the court and it submits that the suit should be dismissed on that ground.\\r\\n\" Later on, the Province of East Bengal was irapleaded as a defendant in the suit and the name of the Income tax Officer of Dacca was removed from the category of defend ants.\\r\\nThe Subordinate Judge then proceeded to try the question of jurisdiction as a preliminary issue, and decided that by virtue of the provisions of the Indian Independence (Legal Proceedings) Order, 1947, read with section 9 of the Indian Independence Act, 1947, the Court had jurisdiction to try the suit against the new Province.\\r\\nThereupon, the respondent (the Province of East Bengal) moved the High Court at Calcutta under section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure, against the order of the Subordinate Judge, and a Bench of the High Court consisting of Harries C.J. and Chakravarthi J. allowed the application and set aside the order of the Subordinate Judge, giving effect to the objec tion of the respondent that the Court at Alipore was not competent to try the suit against the Province of East Bengal.\\r\\nOne of the points raised on behalf of the appellant before the High Court was that the Province of East Bengal had submitted to the jurisdiction \\' of the Subordinate Judge \\'s Court, but this point was negatived.\\r\\nThe appellant was thereafter granted a certificate under section 205 (1) of the Government of India Act, 1935, and on the basis of it he has preferred this appeal.\\r\\n18 On a reference to the judgments of the learned Subordi nate Judge and the High Court, it appears that three provi sions were relied upon by the appellant in support of his contention that the Court at Alipore had jurisdiction to try the suit, these being section 9 of the Indian Independ ence Act, 1947, article 4 of the Indian Independence (Legal Proceedings) Order, 1947, [hereinafter referred to as \\'the Legal Proceedings Order \\'], and section 12 of the Indian Independence (Rights, Property and Liabilities) Order, 1947, Therein after referred to as \\' the Rights, etc., Order \\'].\\r\\nThese provisions run as follows : Section 9 of the Indian Independence Act : \"The Governor General shall by order make such provi sion as appears to him to be necessary or expedient (a) for bringing the provisions of this Act into effective operation; (b) for dividing between the new Dominions, and be tween the new Provinces, to be constituted under this Act, the powers, rights, property, duties and liabilities of the Governor General in Council or, as the case may be, of the relevant Provinces which, under this Act, are to cease to exist . . \" Section 4 of the Legal Proceedings Order : \"Notwithstanding the creation of certain new Provinces and the transfer of certain territories from the Province of Assam to the Province of East Bengal by the Indian Independ ence Act, 1947, (1) all proceedings pending immediately before the appointed day in any civil or criminal court (other than a High Court) in the Province of Bengal, the Punjab or Assam shall be continued in that court as if the said Act had not been passed, and that court shall continue to have for the purposes of the said proceedings all the jurisdiction and powers which it had immediately before the appointed day; (2) any appeal or application for revision in respect of any proceedings so pending in any such 19 court shall lie in the court which would have appellate, or as the case may be revisional, jurisdiction over that court if the proceedings were instituted in that court after the appointed day; and (3) effect shall be given within the territories either of the two Dominions to any judgment, decree, order, or sentence of any such court in the said proceedings, as if it had been passed by a court of competent jurisdiction within that Dominion.\\r\\n\" Section 12 of the Rights, etc.\\r\\nOrder : \"(1) Where immediately before the appointed day, the Governor General in Council is a party to any legal proceed ings with respect to any property, rights or liabilities transferred by this Order, the Dominion which succeeds to the property, rights or liabilities in accordance with the provisions of this Order shall be deemed to be substituted for the Governor General in Council as a party to the pro ceedings, and the proceedings may continue accordingly.\\r\\n(2) Where any Province from which property, rights or liabilities are transferred by this Order is, immediately before the transfer, a party to legal proceedings with respect to that property or those rights or liabilities, the Province which succeeds to the property, rights or liabili ties of this Order shall be deemed to be substituted for the other Province as a party to those proceedings, and the proceedings may continue accordingly.\\r\\n(3) Any proceedings which, immediately before the ap pointed day, are pending by or against the Secretary of State elsewhere than in the United King dom in respect of any liability of the Governor General in Council or a Prov ince shall, * * * * (b) in the case of proceedings in respect, of the Prov ince of Bengal, the Province of the Punjab, or the Province of Assam, be continued by or against the Province which suc ceeds to the liability . . \" The learned Subordinate Judge based his judgment entire ly upon section 4 of the Legal Proceedings 20 Order, but the High Court has pointed out that that Order standing by itself can be of no help to the appellant.\\r\\nAccording to the High Court, that section might have enabled the appellant to prosecute his suit against the Province of Bengal, but it could not enable \\'him to continue the suit against the new Province without invoking section 12 (2) of the Rights, etc.\\r\\nOrder, which provides among other things that the Province which succeeds to the rights or liabilities of the old Province of Bengal by virtue of that Order shall be deemed to be substituted for the latter as a party to the pending proceedings.\\r\\nIn my opinion, this is the correct view.\\r\\nIt Was urged before us that a Court which had juris diction to try a suit against a party would, by reason of what is provided in section 4 of the Legal Proceedings Order, naturally have jurisdiction to substitute the heir or legal representative of that party.\\r\\nGenerally speaking, this must be so, but, in the present case, the Province of East Bengal which forms part of another sovereign State could not be automatically substituted for the Province of Bengal, unless the substitution was permitted by some provision of the Indian Independence Act or any of the Orders issued thereun der.\\r\\nThe whole case thus rests on the proper construction of section 12(2) of the Rights, etc.\\r\\nOrder.\\r\\nIn the High Court, it was strenuously urged on behalf of the appellant that section 12(2) is fully applicable to the present case on account of certain rights having been transferred to the Province of East Bengal from the old Province of Bengal.\\r\\nThis argument was reiterated in this Court also, but it is obviously untenable, for the reasons set out in the judgment of the High Court.\\r\\nAs has been pointed out by the High Court, section 12 (2) is of no help to the appellant, unless the rights in question were transferred by the Rights, etc.\\r\\nOrder itself.\\r\\nThe learned counsel for the appellant however failed to point out any provision of this Order, by which any of the rights referred to by him had been transferred.\\r\\nHe had therefore to fall back upon an alternative argu ment based on section 10(2) of the same Order; and the point to be decided by this Court has thus 21 crystallized into one simple issue, namely, whether section 10(2) of the Order can be of any avail to the appellant.\\r\\nSection 10 (2) must be read with section 10 (1), and the material part of these two sub sections runs as follows : \"10 (1) Where immediately before the appointed day the Governor General in Council is subject to any liability in respect of an actionable wrong other than breach of con tract, that liability shall, (a) where the cause of action arose wholly within the territories which, as from that day, are the territories of the Dominion of India, be a liability of that Dominion;. (2) Where immediately before the appointed day the Province of Bengal is subject to any such liability as aforesaid, that liability shall, (a) where the cause of action arose wholly within the territories which, as from that day, are the territories of the Province of East Bengal, be a liability of that Prov ince; (b) where the cause of action arose wholly within the territories which, as from that day, are the territories of the Province of West Bengal, be a liability of that Prov ince; and (c) in any other case, be a joint liability of the Provinces of East and West Bengal.\" * * * * It is quite clear that for the application of section 10(2), it is necessary to show inter alia that the Province of Bengal was subject to a liability in respect of an ac tionable wrong other than a breach of contract.\\r\\nA reference to any book on tort will show that the words used in sub section\\r\\n(1) are commonly used to define a tort.\\r\\nA tort has been defined in Stroud \\'s Judicial Dictionary, Second Edition, page 2072, as a wrong independent of contract, and it is also so described in the Common Law Procedure Act, 1852 (15 & 16 Vict., c. 76); in Halsbury \\'s Laws of England and in many textbooks.\\r\\nThe difference between \"a wrong independent of contract\" and \"a wrong other than a 22 breach of contract\" is merely verbal and has little signifi cance.\\r\\nA tort is also often referred to as \"an actionable wrong\" and the two expressions have been synonymously used by eminent writers including Sir Fredrick Pollock and Pro fessor Burdick of America, who has designated his well known book on the law of torts as \"a concise treatise on civil liability for actionable wrongs to person and property\".\\r\\nWhether the expression can be taken to be a complete defini tion of a tort may be questioned, because as Addison has pointed out in his book on torts, \"to say that a tort is an actionable wrong leaves undefined the term \\'actionable wrong \\'.\\r\\n\" But there can be no doubt that in legal parlance, the two expressions are assumed to be interchangeable.\\r\\nThere is also another matter to be borne in mind in construing section 10 (2) of the Rights, etc.\\r\\nOrder, and that is the well recognized fact that the primary and most common remedy for a tort is an action for damages.\\r\\nThat this is an important feature of a tort is shown by the fact that in many textbooks an action for damages has been made an inte gral part of the definition of a tort.\\r\\nA few examples will make this clear.\\r\\nA tort is defined by Salmond as \"a civil wrong for which the remedy is a common law action for unliq uidated damages and which is not exclusively the breach of a contract or the breach of a trust or other merely equitable obligation.\" Professor Winfield, who did not see eye to eye with Salmond on many matters connected with the law of torts, gives the following definition of tortious liability : \" Tortious liability arises from the breach of a duty primarily fixed by the law; this duty is towards persons generally and its breach is redressible by an action for unliquidated damages.\\r\\n\" In Underhill \\'s law of torts, the definition runs as follows : \"A tort is an act or omission which is unauthorized by law and independently of contract infringes (i) some absolute right of another, etc., and (ii) gives rise to an action for damages at the suit of the injured party.\\r\\n\" The learned author after attempting to define a tort in this way goes on to state: \"A tort is described in the Common 23 Law Procedure Act, 1852, as a wrong independent of contract.\\r\\nIf we use the word \\'wrong \\' as equivalent to violation of a right recognized and enforced by law by means of an action for damages, the definition is sufficiently accurate, but scarcely very lucid;for it gives no clue to what constitutes a wrong or violation of a right recognized and enforced by law.\\r\\nIt does, however, emphasize the fact that an essential characteristic of a tort is that the appropriate remedy for it is an action for damages.\\r\\nAn act or omission which does not give rise to an action for damages is not a tort.\\r\\n\" It must be recognized that an injunction may also be an appropriate remedy in a limited number of cases, but it is not a remedy of universal application, and no one has yet suggested that it may be treated as an incident of tort.\\r\\nIn the light of the foregoing discussion, it seems to me to be permissible to infer, firstly, that section 10 of the Rights, etc.\\r\\nOrder refers to liability for a tort, and secondly, that what is contemplated there is pecuniary liability such as liability to damages.\\r\\nThe word \"liabili ty\" has a wider meaning and also a narrower meaning, and the latter would appear to be the appropriate meaning where the word is used in contrast to assets or something which corre sponds to or is in the nature of assets, and where it is used in plural or is preceded by an indefinite article, e.g., when the expression \"a liability\" is used.\\r\\nWe must remember that the purpose of the Rights, etc.\\r\\nOrder was, among other things, to divide or distribute the rights, property and liabilities of the undivided Province of Bengal between the two new Provinces.\\r\\nTherefore, the view that the liabilities referred to in section 10 are liabilities capable of being ascertained in terms of money and not liabilities in any abstract or academic sense, is in conso nance with the purpose of the Order as well as the well known fact that for a tort the most common and appropriate remedy is an action for pecuniary damages.\\r\\nThis view is further confirmed by reading section 13 (2) of the Rights, etc.\\r\\nOrder, which runs thus : 24 \"Where by virtue of the preceding provisions of this Order either of the Dominions or any Province becomes sub ject to any liability, and it is just and equitable that a contribution towards that liability should be made by the other Dominion, or by another Province, as the case may be, the other Dominion shall make to the Dominion or Province primarily subject to the liability such contribution in respect thereof as, in default of an agreement, may be determined by the Arbitral Tribunal.\\r\\n\" It should be noted that the words \"becomes subject to any liability\" used in the above provision are practically the words which occur in section 10 of the same Order, and the language of section 13 (2) clearly shows that the word \"liabili ty\" must have been used in the narrower sense of pecuniary liability, because otherwise no question of contribution towards that liability by the Dominion or Province would arise.\\r\\nIt will be also instructive to refer to Part VII, Chapter III of the Government of India Act, 1935, the head ing of which is \"Property, Contracts, Liabilities, and Suits,\" and upon which the Rights, etc.\\r\\nOrder appears tohave been modeled.\\r\\nIn section 179 of the Government of India Act, 1935, which occurs in this Chapter, the clue to the meaning of the word \\' liability. \\' is furnished by the provision that \"any sum ordered to be paid by way of debt, damages or costs in any such proceedings, and any costs or expenses . . shall be paid out of the revenues of the Federation or the Province, as the case may be . . \"I think that it will be quite a fair construction to hold that what is contemplated in section 10 of the Rights, etc.\\r\\nOrder is that the liability referred to therein would be met out of the revenues of the Province concerned.\\r\\nThe construction I have suggested appears to me to represent what the framers of the Order must have intended to convey by the words \"liability in respect of an action able wrong\", but, lest it should be said that it is too narrow a construction, I shall deal with the matter more fully giving to the words \"actionable wrong\" and \"liability\" as wide a meaning as they can 25 bear in a legal context.\\r\\nProceeding on this footing, the first question to be asked is: What is a wrong other than a breach of contract ? In answering this question, it is neither possible nor helpful to ignore all that has been said in authoritative textbooks and judgments in dealing with the question of a tort, because the foundation of every tort is a wrong or a wrongful act.\\r\\nIt is true that at one time some of the writers were inclined to think that \"there was no English law of tort but there was merely an English law of torts, that is, a list of acts and omissions which under certain conditions were actionable.\" But, now, the view has considerably broadened, and, generally speaking, it is acknowledged that \\' \\'torts are infinitely various not limited or confined\" (see Chapman vs pickersgill), and that wherever there is an injury by the invasion of a right, a wrong or a tort is committed.\\r\\nThis is often conveyed by the expression injuria sine damnum.\\r\\nThe word \"wrong\" has been used in sections 17, 18 and 19 of the Code of Civil Proce dure, and the following extract from Mulla \\'s commentary thereon will show how this word has been construed: \"Wrong means a tort or actionable wrong, i.e., an act which is legally wrongful as prejudicially affecting a legal right of the plaintiff.\\r\\n\" Underhill also construes \"wrong\" in the same sense, because a wrong is, according to him, equivalent to viola tion of a right recognised and enforced by law by means of an action for damages.\\r\\nI think therefore that in view of all that has been written and said on the subject, it may be safely stated that a wrong must consist of the following elements : (1) There must be an act or omission amounting to an infringement of a legal right of a person or a breach of legal duty towards him; and (2) The act or omission must have caused harm or damage to that person in some way, the damage being either actual or presumed.\\r\\nThese two elements are denoted by two Latin expressions, injuria and damnum.\\r\\nI have to include (1) [1762] 2 Wils.\\r\\n146, per Pratt C.J. 4 26 presumed damage under the second head, because in certain cases such as trespass, assault, false imprisonment, etc.\\r\\nthe invasion of a right may be so flagrant that \"the law conclusively presumes damage.\" (See observations of Lord Wright M.R. in Nicholls vs Ely Beet Sugar Factory(1 ).\\r\\nSuch cases are often described as cases of absolute liability or cases where a tort is actionable per se without proof of damage.\\r\\nLet us then see whether the two elements of an action able wrong are present in this case.\\r\\nFor this purpose, we must examine the best and most plausible statement of the appellant \\'s case which may be put more or less in the fol lowing way : The issue of a notice, which has been referred to in paragraph S of the plaint calling upon the appellant to furnish a return of his total agricultural income derived from lands situated within the Province of Bengal, was the first step in the initiation of an illegal assessment pro ceeding which was likely to lead to an illegal levy of tax, and the commencement of an illegal proceeding in this manner gave a right of action to the appellant and entitled him to claim an injunction restraining the defendants from complet ing the proceeding.\\r\\nSuch being the position, the case is covered by section 10 of the Order under consideration, the words used there being wide enough to cover liability to be restrained by an injunction from completing an illegal or unauthorized act already commenced.\\r\\nConsequently, the li ability to be so restrained must be deemed to have been transferred to the Province of East Bengal, by virtue of section 10 of the Rights, etc.\\r\\nOrder.\\r\\nThis may appear to be a plausible way of putting the case, but, when we subject it to a close scrutiny, we find that even on the above statement the true requirements of the material provision are not satisfied.\\r\\nIf we confine ourselves to something which has happened, as opposed to something which may happen in future, that is to say, if we look for an act or omission which must be the foundation of every wrong, we find that all that is said to have happened in this (1) 27 case is the issuing of a notice, which is not some unautho rised or prima facie unlawful act but is an act done trader the authority of a statute and enjoined by it.\\r\\nIt has to be borne in mind that the attack in the plaint is not against the whole Act but all that is contended is that only a par ticular provision of it is ultra vires.\\r\\nThe contention comes to this, that the issuing of a notice against every person other than the Ruler of an Indian State would have been a perfectly legitimate act, but the issuing of a notice against a Ruler is ultra vires.\\r\\nBut that is not enough to constitute a wrong.\\r\\nWhat has to be shown is that the issu ing of the notice is a wrongful act, i.e., it amounts to an infringement of some right.\\r\\nWhat known right of person or property or any other description it infringes is not at all clear; nor has that been stated in the pleadings.\\r\\nIt is conceded that there has been no assessment and no realiza tion of any tax and it could not also be disputed that it was open to the appellant to show to the assessing authority that he was not assessable at all.\\r\\nTo say that a notice is the first step , in the initiation of an illegal assessment proceeding, does not carry the matter further, but it would seem to be merely a piece of verbiage used to obscure the fundamental weakness of the appellant \\'s case.\\r\\nConstruing \"wrong\" as it should be construed, the essential thing to find out is in what way a right has been infringed or there has been a breach of duty.\\r\\nIt is the appellant \\'s own case that the suit is for a threatened or apprehended wrong, but that very expression shows that the suit has been brought before the alleged wrong was committed.\\r\\nThe other element of a wrong, namely, that the person should have sustained some harm or injury, is also wanting in this case.\\r\\nIt is not the case of the appellant that the notice has in any way caused any actual damage to him.\\r\\nNor is it suggested that this is one of those cases in which damage should be presumed.\\r\\nAll that is said is that the notice was likely to entail trouble and harassment to the appellant, but that by itself will not constitute a wrong.\\r\\n28 The matter may be tested in another way.\\r\\nAs Underhill points out,\" an act or omission which does not give rise to an action for damages is not a tort.\\r\\n\" To the same effect is the following observation in Salmond \\'s Law of Torts: \" No civil injury is to be classed as a tort unless the appropriate remedy for it is an action for damages.\\r\\nSuch an action is an essential characteristic of every true tort.\\r\\n\" Again, Professor Winfield says that an action for unliqui dated damages is the one sure test of tortious liability and has cited cases where this statement has received judicial approval.\\r\\nI think these statements will be equally true if we drop the word \"tort\" and substitute the words\" actionable wrong\" in its place.\\r\\nIt follows that one of the tests of an actionable wrong is that while other remedies also may be open to the plaintiff, an action for damages is the primary remedy for it.\\r\\nCan the appellant in this case maintain a suit for damages on the allegations made by him in his plaint? As I have already stated, a reference to the plaint shows that no damages has been either alleged or claimed and it has also not been stated that the appellant is entitled to any damage.\\r\\nIn Rogers vs Rajendro Dutt(1)the Privy Council stated that \"it is essential to an action in tort that the act complained of should be legally wrongful as regards the party complaining; that is, it must prejudi cially affect him in some legal right.\\r\\n\" Again, it was ob served in Kali Kischen Tagoor vs Jodoo Lal Mullick(2) that\"there may be, where a right is interfered within ju ria sine damno sufficient to found an action; but no action can be maintained if there is neither damnum nor injuria.\\r\\n\" It seems to me therefore that in the absence of the two elements to which I have referred, no case for liability in respect of an actionable wrong has been made out, and it is wholly inappropriate to invoke section 10 of the Rights, etc.\\r\\nOrder in the present case.\\r\\nIt appears that the whole of the appellant \\'s arguments has been woven round the following two matters : (1) 8 Moore \\'s I.A. 103 at p. 135.\\r\\n(2) 6 I.A. 190.\\r\\n29 (1) Injunction is a recognized form of action; and (2) Injunction has been asked for in the present Case, in connection with something which is said to be likely to culminate in a wrong.\\r\\nThe situation as envisaged is however very different from what is contemplated in section 10 of the Rights, etc.\\r\\nOrder, which is liability for an actionable wrong and not liability for something which may become a wrong in future.\\r\\nIt is to be remembered that there are two words used in the section, viz., actionable and wrong.\\r\\nThe mere fact that a matter is actionable will not bring the case within the four corners of \\' section 10 of the Order, unless all the elements of a wrong are established.\\r\\nI think it will be appropriate at this stage to say a few words about the remedy by way of an injunction in cases where an actionable wrong is said to have been committed.\\r\\nIt cannot be disputed that injunction is one of the remedies in certain cases of torts.\\r\\nAs Addison has pointed out, \"the origin of \\' the remedy by way of an injunction is to be found in the inadequacy of the legal remedy by way of damages in many of the more serious wrongs, such as continuing tres passes and nuisances, where a wrongful act has been done and there was an intention to continue doing it.\\r\\n(See Addison \\'s Law of Torts, 8th Edn. 111).\\r\\nInjunction will also be granted to prevent a threatened injury or wrong, if it can be shown that the threatened act if carried into execution will lead to violation of a right and such will be the inevitable result.\\r\\nAs was pointed out in an English case, the interfer ence of the court in these cases is rounded on its jurisdic tion to give relief in the shape of preventive justice in order to protect properties and rights from that which, if completed, would give a right of action.\\r\\nThese two cases in which an injunction may be issued stand on two different footings, and the liability to an injunction does.\\r\\nnot necessarily and always amount to \"liability in respect of an actionable wrong\".\\r\\nThe two liabilities may possibly coin cide where there is a continuing wrong and the injunction is intended to stop its 30 continuance.\\r\\nBut, as I have already stated, where no wrong has been committed, it would require considerable straining of the meaning of familiar legal expressions to say that \"liability in respect of an actionable wrong\" is identical with \"liability to an injunction in respect of an apprehend ed wrong\".\\r\\n\"Liability in respect of an actionable wrong\" means liability when an actionable wrong has been committed.\\r\\nIt cannot mean liability to be prevented from a wrong which is apprehended.\\r\\nNor can the liability which is contemplated in section 10 of the Rights, etc.\\r\\nOrder be created by the mere filing of a suit in which an injunction is claimed.\\r\\nI should like to refer here to section 176 (1) of the Government of India Act, 1935, which provides as follows : \"The Federation may sue or be sued by the name of the Federation of India and a Provincial Government may sue or be sued by the name of the Province, and, without prejudice to the subsequent provisions of this chapter, may, subject to any provisions which may be made by Act of the Federal Legislature or a Provincial Legislature enacted by virtue of powers conferred on the Legislature by this Act, sue or be sued in relation to their respective affairs in like cases as the Secretary of State in Council might have sued or been sued if this Act had not been passed.\\r\\n\" This section is divisible into two parts.\\r\\nThe first part states as to which authority should be named as a plaintiff or as a defendant in a suit brought by or against the Crown or the Government, and the second part deals with cases in which the Federal or the Provincial Government may sue or be sued.\\r\\nTo understand the latter provision, the section is to be read with section 65 of the Government of India Act, 1858, and section 32 of the Government of India Act, 1915.\\r\\nSection 65 of the Act of 1858 enacted that \"the Secretary of State in Council shall and may sue and be sued as well in India as in England by the name of the Secretary of State in Council as a body corporate; and all persons and bodies politic shall and 31 may have and take the same suits, remedies and proceedings, legal and equitable, against the Secretary of State in Council of India as they could have done against the said Company.\" (East India Co.).\\r\\nThe same provision is substantially made in section 32 of the Act of 1915.\\r\\nSuch being the law, the question has been posed in a number of cases from very early days as to whether, and, if so, in what cases, the Secretary of State would be liable for a wrong or a tort committed by the servants of the Crown, and it has now been definitely held that he may be liable in certain cases.\\r\\nSo far as the present discussion is concerned, the following three points which emerge from a careful perusal of a large number of cases bearing on the subject, seem to be material : (1) The principles of the law of torts have been con sistently applied in all cases dealing with the liability of the Secretary of State for wrongs committed by the serv ants or agents of the crown or the Government.\\r\\n(2) It is settled law that the Secretary of State cannot be held liable for wrongs committed by the servants of the Crown in the performance of duties imposed by the Legisla ture: [See Shivabhajan vs Secretary of State for India(1).\\r\\nJames Evans vs Secretary of State(2).\\r\\nTobin vs Reg(3).\\r\\nRoss vs Secretary of State(4), in which this principle is fully explained and the reasons upon which it is based, are clear ly set out].\\r\\n(3) It is also well settled that where a statute spe cially authorizes a certain act to be done by a certain person, which would otherwise be unlawful or actionable, no action will lie for the doing of the act.\\r\\nOn these principles, it would appear that neither the Agricultural Income tax Officer, who has now been dismissed out of action, nor the Province of East Bengal, could be said to be subject to a liability in respect of an action able wrong, assuming that an actionable wrong has been committed.\\r\\nIt must (1) I.L.R. (3) ; (2) A.I.R. 1920 Lah. 364.\\r\\n(4) I.L.R. 32 however be stated that this conclusion rests on the.\\r\\nas sumption that my construction of an actionable wrong is correct.\\r\\nIt was contended that in deciding the present appeal, we must assume all the facts stated in the plaint to be correct and therefore assume that the Bengal Act is ultra vires and the notice issued was without authority.\\r\\nI have already pointed out that the whole Act is not attacked, but only one single provision thereof is said to be ultra vires, and I shall show later, when I deal with section 65 of the Bengal Act, that even the assumption we are asked to make will not bring the case within section 10 of the Rights, etc.\\r\\nOrder.\\r\\nMr. Setalvad, the learned Attorney General of India, who intervened on behalf of the Union of India in the ap peal, supported the judgment of the High Court on three main grounds, which may be summed up as follows : (1) that the words used in section 10 of the Rights, etc.\\r\\nOrder do not cover this case, because here no wrong has been actually committed and a threatened wrong is different from an actual wrong; (2) that section 65 of the Bengal Agricultural Income tax Act is a bar to the suit; and (3) that the present suit must in any event end in an infructuous decree and should not be allowed to be pursued.\\r\\nI have already dealt with the first point, and wish simply to add that the point which is now pressed is not specifically raised in the Memorandum of Appeal presented in this Court, nor is there any trace of it in the Statement of Case filed by the appellant.\\r\\nThe point which is mentioned in the Memorandum of Appeal and the Statement of Case is that section 12 of the Rights, etc.\\r\\nOrder is applicable to the present case, because certain rights have been trans ferred from the old Province of Bengal to the Province of East Bengal.\\r\\nThere is however no mention of section 10 of the Order, nor is it stated that liability to an injunction brings the case within that 33 section.\\r\\nThus, a notable feature of the case is that almost every argument which was advanced in the courts below is to be discarded, and we are asked to base our decision on a point, which is not urged in the Statement of the Case, and which, in accordance with the rules of practice of this Court, cannot ordinarily be entertained.\\r\\nThe second point urged by Mr. Setalvad is based on section 65 of the Bengal Act, which runs as follows : \"No suit shall be brought in any Civil Court to set aside or modify any assessment made under this Act, and no prosecution, suit or other proceeding shall lie against any officer of the Crown for anything in good faith done or intended to be done under this Act.\" Strictly speaking, this section does not apply to the present case, as there has yet been no assessment and ex facie the appellant \\'s suit cannot be regarded as a suit to set aside or modify any assessment.\\r\\nMr. Setalvad however contends that this section must be read with the decision of the Privy Council in Raleigh Investment Co. vs Governor General in Council(1).\\r\\nThat was a case under the Indian Incometax Act, 1922, the provisions of which are similar to the provisions of the Bengal Act and which contains a sec tion (section67) which is almost identical in terms with section 65 of the latter Act.\\r\\nIn that case, an assessee paid under protest the tax assessed on him and then brought a suit for the following reliefs : (a) a declaration that certain provisions of the Income tax Act on which the assessment was based were ultra vires and so the assessment was illegal; (b) an injunction restraining the.\\r\\nIncome tax Depart ment from making the assessments in future; (c) repayment of the sum assessed.\\r\\nIt was strongly contended upon the facts of the case that section 67 of the Income tax Act had no application, but it was held by the Privy Council that \"though in form the relief claimed did not profess to (1) 5 34 modify or set aside the assessment, in substance it did,because the repayment could not be ordered so long as the assessment stood \\' \\'.\\r\\nIt was further held that an as sessment made under the machinery provided by the Act, if based on a provision subsequently held to be ultra vires was not a nullity but a mistake of law in the course of its exercise.\\r\\nLastly, it was held that the Act contained machin ery which enabled an assessee to raise the question whether or not a particular provision of the Act bearing on the assessment made upon him was ultra vires and that jurisdic tion to question the assessment otherwise than by use of the machinery expressly provided by the Act appeared to be inconsistent with the statutory obligation to pay \\'arising by virtue of the assessment.\\r\\nThe material part of the judgment on the last point runs as follows : \"In construing the section it is pertinent in their Lord ships \\' opinion, to ascertain whether the Act contains machinery which enables an assessee effectively to raise in the Courts the question whether the particular provision of the Income tax Act bearing on the assessment made is or is not ultra vires.\\r\\nThe presence of such machinery, though by no means conclusive, marches with a construction of the section which denies an alternative jurisdiction to enquire into the same subject matter.\\r\\nThe absence of such machinery would greatly assist the appellant on the question of con struction and, indeed, it may be added that, if there were no such machinery and if the section affected to preclude the High Court in its ordinary civil jurisdiction from considering a point of ultra vires, there would be a serious question whether the opening part of the section, so far as it debarred the question of ultra vires being debated, fell within the competence of the Legislature.\\r\\nIn their Lordships view it is clear that the In come tax Act, 1922, as it stood at the relevant, date,did give the assessee the right effectively to raise inrelation to an assessment made upon him the question whether or not a provision in the Act was ultra vires.\\r\\nUnder section 30, an assessee whose only ground of complaint was that effect had been given in the assessment 35 to a provision which he contended was ultra vires might appeal against the assessment.\\r\\nIf he were dissatisfied with the decision on appeal the details relating to the procedure are immaterial the assessee could ask for a case to be stated on any question of law for the opinion of the High Court and, if his request were refused, he might apply to the High Court for an order requiring a case to be stated and to be referred to the High Court .\\r\\nIt cannot be doubted that included in the questions of law which might be raised by a case stated is any question as to the validity of any taxing provision in the Income tax Act to which effect has been given in the assessment under review.\\r\\nAny decision of the High Court upon that question of law can be reviewed on appeal.\\r\\nEffective and appropriate machinery is therefore provided by the Act itself for the review on grounds of law of any assessment.\\r\\nIt is in that setting that section 67 has to be construed.\\r\\nIn conclusion their Lordships would observe that the scheme of the Act is to set up a particular machinery by the use of which alone total income assessable for income tax is to be ascertained.\\r\\nThe income tax exigible is determined by reference to the total income so ascertained and only by reference to such total income.\\r\\nUnder the Act (section 45) there arises a duty to pay the amount of tax demanded on the basis of that assessment of total income.\\r\\nJurisdiction to ques tion the assessment otherwise than by use of the machinery expressly provided by the Act would appear to be inconsist ent with the statutory obligation to pay arising by virtue of the assessment.\\r\\nThe only doubt, indeed, in their Lord ships \\' mind, is whether an express provision was necessary in order to exclude jurisdiction in a civil Court to set aside or modify an assessment.\\r\\n\" The authority of this decision was not questioned before us, but it was pointed out firstly that the present suit is not hit by the first part of section 65 of the Bengal Act, which refers only to suits to set aside or modify any as sessment, and secondly, that if the case is not covered by section65, the decision of the Privy Council, which was based on the construction of section 36 67 of the Income tax Act, is not applicable.\\r\\nMr. Setalvad, replying to the first contention, has urged that we must not look merely to the letter of the section but to the princi ple underlying it, and he has particularly referred us to the fact that, strictly speaking, the reliefs claimed in the above mentioned case do not fall within the letter of sec tion 67 of the Income tax Act and hence the Privy Council observed in that case: \"In form the relief claimed does not profess to modify or set aside, the assessment.\\r\\nIn sub stance it does .\\r\\nThe cloud of words fails to obscure the point of the suit.\\r\\n\" However that may be, it seems to me that the Privy Council in arriving at their decision, were influenced not only by the language of section 67 of the Income tax Act but also by the complete machinery furnished by that Act for dealing with all questions arising in regard to the assessment, including the question of ultra vires as would appear from the fact that while laying down that there was no jurisdiction to question the assessment except by use of the machinery expressly provided by the Act, their Lord ships added: \"The only doubt, indeed, in their Lordships \\' mind, is whether an express provision was necessary in order to exclude jurisdiction in a civil court to set aside or modify an assessment.\" think that, for the purpose of understanding the full scope of section 65, we must read not only the first part of the section which bars suits to set aside or modify an assessment, but also its latter part which provides that \"no suit or other proceeding shall lie against any officer of the Crown for anything in good faith. intended to be done under this Act.\" The latter part of the section clearly excludes the jurisdiction of the court to prevent the Income tax Officer from proceeding With an assessment which has already been started.\\r\\nReference may here be made to Secretary of State vs Meyyappa Chetti ar(1) where it was held that the expression \"intended to be done\" signified futurity so as to preclude suits for injunction in respect of proceedings \\'intended \\' to be taken by the Income tax Officer.\\r\\nIt is true that in terms the provision concerns the Income tax Officer only, but it (1) I1946] , at 352.\\r\\n37 could hardly have been the intention of the Legislature that though that Officer is not liable to be restrained from proceeding with an assessment, the provision which ensures such a result may be rendered nugatory by permitting an injunction to be claimed against the Provincial Government or the State.\\r\\nIn my opinion, it will be a strange construc tion of the section to hold that although it bars suits to modify or set aside an assessment and though it bars all proceedings to restrain the Officer who is making the as sessment from proceeding with it, yet it leaves it open to a party to stop an assessment by claiming an injunction against the Provincial Government or the State instead of the Officer concerned.\\r\\nThere is no reference to the Provincial Government or the State at all in the first or the second part of the section, but the section as a whole concerns only with excluding the jurisdiction of the civil court in regard to certain acts done or intended to be done in connection with the assessment of agricultural income tax, and, on a fair construction, it must be held to bar all suits in connection with such assessment.\\r\\nIn urging his third point, the learned Attorney General relied on an Ordinance passed by the Governor General of Pakistan on the 13th November, 1948, section 2 whereof runs as follows : \"No judgment, decree, order or sentence referred to in paragraph (3) of Article 4 of the Indian Independence (Legal Proceedings) Order, 1947, shall affect the legislative or executive right or authority of the Central or any Provin cial Government of Pakistan and where such right or authori ty has been at issue, the judgment, decree, order or sen tence shall be invalid and inoperative subject to any decision that may be obtained from a competent court, of the Province concerned.\\r\\n\" It was pointed out that by reason of this Ordinance, any decree which may be obtained in the present suit would be wholly infructuous and in this view this was a meaningless litigation which should not be allowed to continue.\\r\\nThere is force in this argument, 38 but the point need not be pursued, as, in my opinion, the first two points raised by the Attorney General are suffi cient to meet the principal contention advanced by the appellant.\\r\\nThe question of submission to jurisdiction appears to me to be unarguable upon the facts stated, and it was not seriously argued before us.\\r\\nThe Province of East Bengal did intervene and apply for permission to file a written state ment, but the only statement made by it was that the Court had no jurisdiction to proceed with the suit.\\r\\nIt cannot therefore be held that it had submitted to the jurisdiction of the Court.\\r\\nI have tried to deal with the question posed in this appeal in all its material aspects, but it can, I think, be disposed of on the simple ground that the mere issuing of a notice under section 4 of the Bengal Agricultural Income tax Act by the Agricultural Income tax Officer cannot be held to be an actionable wrong, because no right known to law can be said to have been infringed thereby.\\r\\nOne of the recognized tests of an actionable wrong is that, while other remedies may also be open to the person to whom the wrong is done, he can always maintain an action for damages, on the principle that every injury imports damage.\\r\\nI am however certain that no action for damages can be maintained on the allegations made by the appellant in his plaint.\\r\\nI think that the entire argument urged on behalf of the appellant has been sufficiently answered by the High Court in the following passage, which appears to me to sum up the legal position accurately and concisely : \"Nor was Dr. Sen Gupta right in relying on article 10 (2) for the transfer of liabilities.\\r\\nThat Article is con cerned with liability for an actionable wrong other than breach of contract and it is impossible to say that by serving a notice on the plaintiff under the Bengal Agricul tural Income Tax Act through one of its officers, the Prov ince of Bengal had committed an actionable wrong.\\r\\nAssuming it exceeded its powers or acted under an invalid provision of law, the plaintiff may have a declaration to that effect, but the 39 act complained of cannot be said to have been a tortious act.\\r\\nBut even assuming it was, it is to be remembered that the issue of the notice was in exercise of powers conferred by the Act in relation to the Sovereign rights of the Crown and it is elementary that the Crown or the State is not answerable for even negligent or tortious acts of its offi cers done in the Course of their official duties imposed by statute, except where the particular act was specifically directed and the Crown profited by its performance.\\r\\nThere is no such allegation in the plaint in the present case.\\r\\nThe plaintiff could not therefore have sued the Province of Bengal for an actionable wrong and the suit actually brought is not a suit of that character.\\r\\nIt is a suit for ,certain declarations and an injunction and does not seek to make the Province liable for any actionable wrong in any way.\\r\\nNo liability for an actionable wrong is thus involved in the suit and Dr. Sen Gupta cannot establish a right to proceed against the Province of East Bengal on the basis that the liability was transferred to that Province under article 10 (2) of the Order.\\r\\n\" In the result, I would dismiss this appeal with costs.\\r\\nMUKHERJEA J I agree with my learned brother Patanjali Sastri J. that this appeal should be allowed and I would desire to indicate briefly the reasons that have weighed with me in coming to a conclusion different from that ar rived at by the learned Judges of the Calcutta High Court.\\r\\nAll the material facts in relation to this case have been set out with elaborate fullness in the judgment of the High Court and I deem it quite unnecessary to state them over again.\\r\\nThe whole controversy centers round the point as to whether the suit which was instituted by the plaintiff appellant against the Province of Bengal, as it was prior to the 15th of August, 1947, and which is still pending in the Court of the Subordinate Judge at Alipore can be continued against the Province of East Bengal which has come into existence, as a part of the Dominion of Pakistan, upon the 40 partition of Bengal under the Indian Independence Act; and whether the court of the Subordinate Judge of Alipore which is a court in the Dominion of India has any jurisdiction to proceed with and try such suit.\\r\\nThe Subordinate JUdge decided these questions in favour of the plaintiff appellant basing his decision entirely upon article 4 (1) of the Indian Independence (Legal proceedings) Order, 1947, read with section 9 of the Indian Independence Act.\\r\\nThe High Court in revision \\' set aside the order of the Subordinate Judge holding inter alia that neither article 4 (1) of the Legal Proceedings Order nor article 12 (2) of the Indian Independence (Rights, Property and Liabilities) Order, 1947, could confer upon the plaintiff any right to continue the suit against the Province of East Bengal.\\r\\nThe Alipore Court, it has been held, has no jurisdiction to proceed with the suit and no jurisdiction has been conferred upon it by reason of the Province of East Bengal appearing in the suit and putting in a written statement only for the purpose of challenging the competency of the court to try the same.\\r\\nIt is the propriety of this decision that has been challenged before us in this appeal.\\r\\nThe first point that requires consideration is whether article 4 (11 of the Legal Proceedings Order has any appli cation to the facts of the present case.\\r\\nIn my opinion, the answer to this question must be in the negative and the view taken by the High Court on this point seems to me to be perfectly sound and unassailable.\\r\\nThe Legal Proceedings Order as well as several other orders dealing with various constitutional matters affecting the two Dominions which were to come into being on and from the 15th of August, 1947, were promulgated by the Governor General of India just on the previous day, that is to say, the 14th of August, 1947, in pursuance of section 9 (1) of the Indian Independence Act which made it a duty on the part of the Governor General to make suitable provisions for removing the difficulties arising in connection with the transition to the new constitutional order.\\r\\nAs the two 41 Dominions came into existence under the Indian Independence Act passed by the British Parliament and these orders were made by the Governor General of India in exercise of the authority conferred upon him by the Independence Act, there cannot be any doubt that the provisions of these orders are fully binding on India as well as the Dominion of Pakistan; and they being provisions made to be applicable only for the transitional period, the question does not really arise as to whether or not they are in strict conformity with the principles of International Law which would ordinarily govern the relations between two sovereign States.\\r\\nArticle 4(1) of the Legal Proceedings Order is worded as follows: \"Notwithstanding the creation of certain new Provinces and the transfer of certain territories from the Province of Assam to the Province of East Bengal by the Indian Independ ence Act, 1947, (1) all proceedings pending immediately before the appointed day in any civil or criminal court (other than a High Court) in the Province of Bengal, the Punjab or Assam shall be continued in that court as if the said Act had not been passed, and that court shall continue to have for the purposes of the said proceedings all the jurisdiction and powers which it had immediately before the appointed day.\\r\\n\" The clause of the article is couched in very wide lan guage and under it all proceedings pending in any civil or criminal court in the Province of Bengal, the Punjab or Assam immediately before the 15th of August, 1947, would continue as before and be heard and tried by the courts before which they are pending irrespective of the fact that such proceedings might relate to persons or property situat ed in the other Dominion.\\r\\nI agree with the High Court in holding that comprehensive though the provision is, by itself it can render no assistance to the plaintiff appel lant.\\r\\nThe suit was commenced here by the plaintiff against the old Province of Bengal as the party defendant and against 42 that defendant the suit may be continued if the plaintiff so chooses under article 4(1) of the Legal Proceedings Order mentioned above.\\r\\nBut this would be of no benefit or advan tage to the plaintiff for what he wants is to proceed against the Province of East Bengal which is a part of the Dominion of Pakistan as a substituted defendant in place of the Province of Bengal.\\r\\nDr. Sen Gupta argues that if the court has jurisdiction to continue the suit, this would necessarily carry with it the power to make proper orders for substitution as the court considers necessary.\\r\\nBut such substitution could be made only under the ordinary provi sions of law which regulate the conduct of such suits.\\r\\nThere is no provision of any municipal law which contemplates or authorises the substitution of one sovereign state for another in a pending suit.\\r\\nIf, therefore, the plaintiff wants to proceed against the new Province of East Bengal, he must find warrant for it in some of the provisions made by the Governor General of Indian exercise of the powers vested in him under the Indian Independence Act.\\r\\nAdmittedly there is no such provision in the Legal Proceedings Act and reli ance is, therefore, placed by the plaintiff upon article 12 (2) of the Rights, Property and Liabilities Order, 1947, which is in the following terms : \"Where any Province from which property, rights or liabilities are transferred by this Order is, immediately before the transfer, a party to legal proceeding with re spect to that property or those rights or liabilities, the Province which succeeds to the property, rights or liabili ties in accordance with the provisions of this Order shall be deemed to be substituted for the other Province as a party to those proceedings, and the proceedings may con tinue accordingly.\\r\\nIt is not disputed that in order to attract the opera tion of this provision, it is incumbent upon the plaintiff to show that the right or liability to which his suit re lates has been transferred from the Province of Bengal, as it existed prior to the 15th of August, 1947, 43 to the Province of East Bengal in Pakistan in accordance with the provisions of this Order.\\r\\nTo establish this, reli ance was placed on behalf of the plaintiff upon several provisions of the Rights, Property and Liabililies Order, 1947, and none of his contentions in this respect were accepted as sound by the learned Judges of the High Court.\\r\\nIn this court Dr. Sen Gupta took his stand on a two fold ground.\\r\\nHe argued in the first place that for the purpose of invoking the aid of article 12(2) of the Rights, Proper ty \\' and Liabilities Order it is not necessary that the transfer of the right and liability to which the proceeding relates should take place under any of the specific articles enumerated in the Order.\\r\\nIt would be enough according to him, if there is a transfer by or under any machinery which the Order sets up or authorises What he says is that as the Province of East Bengal is proceeding to assess and levy agricultural income tax upon the plaintiff in respect of a period anterior to 15th of August, 1947, the right to do so can vest in the Province either under an agreement between the two Dominions or the two Provinces or on the basis of an award by an arbitral tribunal as contemplated by article 3 of the Rights, Property and Liabilities Order.\\r\\nIn either case it would amount to transfer of rights under the provi sions of the Order and would attract the operation of arti cle 12(2).\\r\\nThis argument is manifestly unsound and cannot be ac cepted.\\r\\nIf the right referred to by the learned Counsel means the fight to impose tax on agricultural income earned within its territory, the State of Pakistan did not acquire such right by transfer from the Province of Bengal.\\r\\nIt is a right inherent in sovereignty itself which the Dominion of Pakistan got under the Indian Independence Act.\\r\\nAgain if the right has been created by the Bengal Agricultural In come tax Act, the Province of East Bengal would certainly be entitled to avail itself of the provisions of that Act under section 18(3) of the Independence Act.\\r\\nApart from this, Dr. Sen Gupta has not referred us to any agreement between the two Dominions or the two Provinces or to the decision of any arbitral tribunal 44 under which the right in dispute in the present case was transferred to the Province of East Bengal.\\r\\nThis contention must therefore fail.\\r\\nI have now to consider the other argument on this point advanced by the learned Counsel that the liability of the Province of Bengal in respect to the cause of action upon which the plaintiff \\'s suit had been rounded became a liabil ity of the Province of East Bengal under the provision of article 10(2) of the Rights, Property and Liabilities Order.\\r\\nIt is not disputed that if this contention succeeds, the plaintiff would be entitled to the benefit of clause (2) of article 12 of the Order.\\r\\nClause (2) of article 10 has to be read with clause (1) of that article and taking the two clauses together the provision of article 10(2) would stand thus : \"Where immediately before the appointed day the Province of Bengal is subject to any liability in respect of an actionable wrong other than a breach of contract, the li ability shall (a) when the cause of action arose wholly within the territory which as from that day are the territories of the Province of East Bengal be a liability of that Province.\\r\\n\" If the allegations made by the plaintiff in the plaint are assumed to be correct, the Province of Bengal was liable to be restrained from proceeding to levy agricultural income tax upon the plaintiff which was illegal, as being imposed by a statute which so far as it affected the plain tiff was unconstitutional and void.\\r\\nThe question is whether this can be said to be a liability in respect of an action able wrong other than a breach of contract within the meaning of that expression occurring in article 10 set out above.\\r\\nIt may be noted here that the rights and liabilities arising out of contracts have been dealt with in articles 8 and 9 of the Order.\\r\\nThe High Court took the view that the expression \"actionable wrong other than a breach contract\" is synonymous with \\'tort \\'.\\r\\nIt has held that the act com plained of cannot be a tortious act and 45 even if it is so, no action would lie upon it, it being an established proposition of law that the State is not answer able for any tortious acts of its officers done in the course of official duties imposed by a Statute.\\r\\nIt seems to me that the learned Judges have attached a narrow and some what restricted meaning to the words of the Article men tioned above and that the plain language of the provision read in the light of the context would demand and justify a wider and more liberal interpretation.\\r\\nIn my opinion, there can be an actionable wrong which does not arise out of a breach of contract and at the same time does not answer to the description of a \\'tort \\' as it is understood in English law; and if the plaintiff \\'s allegations are correct, it is an actionable wrong precisely of that type which we have in the present case.\\r\\nThe word \"wrong\" in ordinary legal language means and signifies \"privation of right\".\\r\\nAn act is wrongful it infringes the legal right of another, and \"actionable\" means nothing else than that it affords grounds for action in law.\\r\\nOrdinarily, the word \"injury\" is used in the same sense of actionable wrong, while \"damage in contrast with injury means loss or harm occurring in fact whether actionable as injury or not\"(1).\\r\\nIn English law \"tort\" is a species of civil injury and so is a breach of contract; but it is not quite correct to say that the two together exhaust all forms of actionable wrongs known to English law.\\r\\nIt is true that a tort is often described as wrong independent of contract.\\r\\nAs a legal definition this description, as I shall show presently, is not quite accurate and unless taken with certain limitations is apt to be misleading.\\r\\nIt is well known that in England the principles of modern law of contract and tort emerged solely out of the intricacies of the old \"Forms of Action \\'\" under which they lay buried for ages.\\r\\nThe injuries which in modern law are described as torts were remedied in early time by certain writs, known as writs of trespass (1) Vide the observation of Viscount Simon in Crofter etc.\\r\\nCompany Ltd vs Vetch ; , 442. 46 and trespass on the case.\\r\\nThe latter was more elastic than the former and was capable of being adapted to new circum stances and to new types of injuries.\\r\\nThere was no clear line of demarcation in those days between contractual and tortious liability and in fact tile aCtiOn of \"assumpsit\" which was the method of enforcing simple contracts was a variety of action on the case and was made use of for recov ery of compensation from a party who failed to perform his agreement on the ground that such failure amounted to a wrong in the nature of deceit(1).\\r\\nWhen the principles of substantive law gradually extri cated themselves from the entanglements of for realistic procedure, a distinction was drawn between liability for breach of contract and that for tort.\\r\\nIn a breach of con tract the right violated owes its origin to the agreement of the parties while in tort the right infringed is one created by tile general law of the land.\\r\\nFrom about the middle of the 19th century the assumption current in England was that all civil causes of action must be rounded either on con tract or on tort and all injuries which were not breaches of contract would come under the category of torts.\\r\\nThis as sumption as Sir Frederick Pollock observes has no historical foundation to rest upon(2).\\r\\nIn 1852 the Common Law Proce dure Act was passed and a tort was described in the Act as \"a wrong independent of contract\".\\r\\nIt cannot be denied that this mode of expression became very common in legal par lance; but as more than one modern writer on the law of torts have pointed out, the words in such description would have to be interpreted in a particular way and with certain limitations; taken literally it would not be a correct statement of law.\\r\\nIt has been observed by Underhill in his \"Law of Torts\" that a description like this would be accurate in law if the word \"wrong\" is taken in the restricted and technical sense as equivalent to \"violation of a right (1) Vide Pollock on Contract, 12th Edition, p. 111; Winfield on Tort pp, 3 4 (4th Edition).\\r\\n(2) Vide Pollock \\'s Article on Tort, Encyc.\\r\\nVol.22, p. 307.\\r\\n47 recognised and enforced by law by means of an action for damages\".\\r\\nTaken in this form, the definition though it gives no clue as to what constitutes a wrong, certainly does lay stress on the essential characteristic of a tort, viz., that the appropriate remedy f9r it is an action for damages(1).\\r\\nIt is really this characteristic that differen tiates a tort from other forms of civil injury or actionable wrong even though the latter are unconnected with any con tract.\\r\\nThere may be other remedies besides damages avail able to the plaintiff against a tortfeasor in the shape of restitution, injunction etc.\\r\\n, but no \"civil injury\" as Salmond observes \"can be classed as tort unless the appro priate remedy for it is an action for damages.\\r\\nSuch an action is an essential characteristic of every true tort.\\r\\n\"(2) Other remedies like injunction or restitution can be claimed by the plaintiff but it is solely by virtue of a right to damages that the wrong complained of can be regard ed as a tort.\\r\\nBy way of illustration the author points out that a public nuisance is not to be deemed a tort, because the civil remedy by way of injunction may be obtained at the suit of the Attorney General.\\r\\nA refusal to perform a statu tory duty is not a tort if the remedy is by way of mandamus.\\r\\nNor would any wrong be regarded as a tort if the remedy is not an action for unliquidated damages but for a liquidated sum of money.\\r\\nA breach of trust is certainly an actionable wrong independent of contract and the beneficiaries can claim compensation if the trustee has misappropriated trust property; but as the claim cannot be for unliquidated damages, it is not regarded as a tort(3).\\r\\nAccording to Salmond, the reason for this exclusion is purely historical as a breach of trust or any other equitable obligation was considered to be within the special jurisdiction of equity courts.\\r\\nIt is interesting to observe that although the difference between equitable and common law jurisdiction is not existent at the present day, the old rule is still applied (1) Vide Underbill \\'s Law of Torts.\\r\\n16th Edn., p. 4.\\r\\n(2) Vide Salmond \\'s Law of Torts, 10th Edn., pp. 7 & 8.\\r\\n(3) Vide Winfield \\'s Law of Tort, p. 11 48 to demarcate the boundary of the law of torts in English common law.\\r\\nThus tort is a civil injury other than a breach of contract which is capable of sustaining an action for unliq uidated damages in a court of law.\\r\\nIf the appropriate remedy is not a claim for unliquidated damages but for injunction or some other relief, it would not rank as a tort though all the same it would be an actionable wrong.\\r\\nBy way of illustration I may refer to the case of Halsey vs Brotherhood(1) which was decided by Sir George Jessel.\\r\\nBoth the plaintiff and defendant in this case were engineers and held patents for the manufacture of certain types of engines.\\r\\nThe plaintiff brought an action against the de fendant alleging that the latter had threatened to bring legal proceedings against several persons who were actual or intending purchasers of engines from the plaintiff assert ing that the engines manufactured by the plaintiff were infringements of the defendant \\'s patent.\\r\\nThere was a claim for damages and also for injunction.\\r\\nIt was held by Sir George Jessel that the plaintiff could not claim damages on the basis of slander of title, as he nowhere alleged that the defendant \\'s statements or representations were not bona fide.\\r\\nBut even though the statements had been made in good faith, the plaintiff would be entitled to an injunction against the defendant if he succeeded in proving that the latter \\'s allegations of infringement were not true.\\r\\nAs no proper case for injunction on this basis was made in the claim, the action was dismissed; but liberty was given to the plaintiff to bring an action in the proper form claiming an injunction to restrain the defendant from threatening the plaintiff \\'s customers.\\r\\nThis threat to customers was thus held to be an actionable wrong but as the remedy was injunc tion and not damages, it was not a tort in the legal sense of the term.\\r\\nIn the case before us the act of the Province of Bengal complained of by the plaintiff is not a tort according to the technical rules (1) 49 of English law, but is certainly an actionable wrong as it can be sued upon in a court of law and remedied in an effective manner.\\r\\nThe appropriate remedy for the wrong is not unliquidated damages which is essential in a tort but an injunction restraining the defendant from proceeding with the illegal assessment or from realising the amount assessed if assessment has actually taken place.\\r\\nIf, as the plaintiff alleges, the relevant provision of the Bengal Agricultural Income tax Act, under which the plaintiff is sought to be assessed, is illegal and ultra vires, the issuing of the notice by the Income tax Officer is certainly the first and the essential step in the commis sion of the wrongful act which furnishes a sufficient cause of action for the suit.\\r\\nAs this is not a case of tort, the principle of law, according to which a state is not liable to any damages for tortious acts of its servants, cannot be invoked as a bar to the suit.\\r\\nA remedy by way of injunction can be claimed against a State or Province unless the act complained of amounts to an \\'act of State \\' in its strict sense and is not purported to be done in exercise of the powers conferred upon the Government by any municipal law.\\r\\nAs the avowed object of the Rights, Property and Liabilities Order is to distribute and adjust as far as possible the rights, properties and liabilities between the two Dominions which were to come into being under the Indian Independence Act, the language of the Order should be construed as liber ally as possible, and there is no warrant for putting an interpretation upon the words used more restricted than they would bear in English law.\\r\\nIt is argued that article 10(2) (a) does not apply to this case as the cause of action did not wholly arise within the territory of the Province of East Bengal.\\r\\nThe argument does not impress me at all.\\r\\nThe notice was issued by the Income tax Officer of Dacca which is in Pakistan territory though it was received by the plaintiff \\'s manager at Agarta la which was outside British India at that time.\\r\\nIn any event, the Province 50 of East Bengal cannot escape liability on this ground.\\r\\nIt would be jointly liable with the Province of West Bengal under article 10(2) (c) of the Rights, Property and Liabili ties Order.\\r\\nIn view of my decision on this point, the other question raised by Dr. Sen Gupta as to whether the defendant submit ted to the jurisdiction of the Alipore Court or not does not fall for determination.\\r\\nThe learned Attorney General, who intervened on behalf of the Union of India, put forward certain additional grounds in support of the order made by the learned Judges of the High Court.\\r\\nOne of the points raised by him is that section 65 of the Bengal Agricultural Income tax Act con stitutes a bar to the suit which, therefore, should not be allowed to \\'continue.\\r\\nThe other material point is that the suit cannot but result in an infructuous decree, and conse quently there is no justification for allowing it to pro ceed.\\r\\nIt is pointed out that an Ordinance has been passed by the GovernorGeneral of Pakistan on the 13th of November, 1948, under which \"no judgment, decree or order referred to in paragraph 3 of Article 4 of the Indian Independence (Legal Proceedings) Order, 1947, shall, in any way, affect the legislative or executive right or authority of the Central or any Provincial Government of Pakistan and where such authority or right has been at issue, the judgment, decree or order shall be invalid and inoperative\".\\r\\nThe first point has been dealt with by my learned brother Patan jali Sastri J. in his judgment and I concur with him in holding that section 65 of the Bengal Agricultural Income tax Act has no application to the present case.\\r\\nThe second point, I must say, embarrassed me to some extent and if the effect of the Ordinance is, as has been stated by the learned Attorney General, a doubt may legitimately arise whether it would be worthwhile for the plaintiff to proceed with the suit and whether it would not be more to his advan tage to seek relief in the court of Dacca.\\r\\nBut as this point was not raised before the High Court and the question whether an Ordinance of this character could override the provisions of the 51 Orders passed by the Governor General of India under the Indian Independence Act has still to be decided, I refrain from expressing any opinion on this point.\\r\\nIn the result, the appeal, in my opinion, should be allowed and I concur in the order which has been made by my learned brother Patanjali Sastri, J. Appeal allowed.\\r\\nAgent for the Appellant: R.R. Biswas.\\r\\nAgent for the Respondent: P.K. Bose.\\r\\nAgent for the Inervener: P.
